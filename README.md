# Image-Classifier
In this project,
you'll be implementing an image classification application.
This app will train a deep learning model on a data set of images,
then use the trained model to classify images.
First, you'll develop your code in a Jupyter notebook to make sure your training implementation works.
Then, you'll convert the code to a Python application that runs from the command line. Good luck.
